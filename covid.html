<h1>Covid-19</h1>
  <p class="tekst-covid">According to Redd Barna, school dropout is a continuous problem all over the world, especially in a country like Niger.<br> Because of school shutdown due to COVID 19, many of these children will not return and the problem will only get bigger.<br> FHI recommends social distancing as one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID 19.<br> Based on the Principles for Digital Development and the research questions; “How can attendance and enrolment data prevent dropout in school?”,<br> and “How can technology play a role in solving the issue?”, we have decided to focus our innovation on how to solve dropout as a direct consequence of the pandemic.<br> NOvid will make social distancing effortless.</p>
