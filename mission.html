  <h2>The Novid-pin</h2>
  <p class="pin-tekst">The appearance of the Novid is circular. NOvid should be waterproof because it is mainly for children, and should withstand play (with water) and fun. It measures approximately 1.25m from other pins, it emits a vibration and a constant red light along the edge of the chip when it is within 1.25m from another. The pin is powered by a watch battery that is found in quartz watches, and lasts for about 1-2 years. The pin is on an NFC (near field communication) docking and will be activated as soon as itâ€™s removed. Furthermore, the pin is attached with a clip, similar to a small microphone used in TV broadcasts. It will also be possible to personally customize a cover with an individual design that the pin can be placed in. The pin will be approximately the same size as a 42mm wristwatch.
